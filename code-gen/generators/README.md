# Generators

This package is part of the [Go-DOM](https://github.com/stroiman/go-dom) to
support code generation from web specification IDL files.

However, the code is of general use, and exposed publicly.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This package is part of the code generator itself, which is of no interest
> outside Go-DOM, and makes no guarantees about backwards compatibility.
>
> If you find it useful, I suggest copy/paste the code to your own project.

> Code is poorly documented, I will improve as I work more with this.

## Build on top of Jennifer

This library is a wrapper on top of [Jennifer](https://github.com/dave/jennifer)

Jennifer is a comprehensive library for generating go code generators, but I did
not agree with the design choices in the interface.

- Jennifer has an imperative API, i.e. it mutates values
- IMHO, the API Jennifer exposes is too low-level

### Declarative vs. Imperative

This type of problem lends itself very well to a declarative composition. In
fact, this problem is very similar to building a UI. Modern web frameworks
generally compose high level components of low level components, each component
being a function of state.

Jennifer however, is designed around mutation.

### Level of abstraction

Jennifer has a model centered around the output tokens generated in code, e.g.
there is a `Func` representing the `func` keyword. But the keword has different
uses.

- Declaring a function type
- Declaring a function literal

Likewise, `*` is created using `Op("*")`, but this has multiple uses as well:

- Declaring a pointer type
- Dereferencing a pointer variable

`Index` represents `[]`, which can be used to index a slice or map, as well as
providing a type parameter to a generic type or function.

This library tries to focus on what the code should do, not the pieces that they
are constructed of, and uses an abstraction level of "Variable assignment",
"Pointer", "Reference", "Equals", rather than `Op(":=")`, `Op("*")`, `Op("&")`,
`Op("==")`.

If `t` is a `Type` representing a type in code, `t.Pointer()` represents the
pointer type to that type. If `v` is a `Value` representing an value, e.g., an
identifier, a struct literal, `t.Reference()` gives the reference to the value.

## Examples

This is not a full documentation, just to get you started.

Everything in this library is a `Generator`, and interface representing the
`Generate` function that can return a `*jen.Statement`.

```go
type Generator interface {
	Generate() *jen.Statement
}
```

### Types and Values

Two types, `Type` and `Value` are simple wrappers on top of `Generator` to
provide easy access to constructs 

E.g., on a `Value`, you can access fields, or call them. On a 

```Go
v := g.NewValue("MyStruct")
return StatementList(
    g.Assign(v, g.NewValue("NewMyStruct").Call()),
    g.Field("Initialize").Call(),
    g.Return(v),
    )
```

### Conditions

Simple `if`/`else` is implemented by `IfStmt`. `Eq` and `Neq` provides `==` and
`!=` support. `Gte`, greater-than or equal, is `>=`

```Go
IfStmt{
    Condition: Eq{ Lhs: value1, Rhs: Value2 },
    Block: someFunctionValue.Call(),
    // Else is optional
    Else: someOtherFunctionValue.Call(),
}
```

### Escape Hatch

Not everything is supported. To deal with that, the `Raw` generator can wrap a
native Jennifer statement. E.g., at the moment, `append` is not supported, so
here `Raw` is used:

```Go
items := NewValue("items")
item := NewValue("item")
functionBody := StatementList(
    Assign(item, NewValue("NewItem").Call()),
    Reassign(items,
        Raw(jen.Append(items.Generate(), item.Generate())),
    ),
)
// Generates
// item := NewItem()
// items = append(items, item)
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you create custom support for new constructs, please add them

### Creating a file

This package does not handle the overall file creation, package specification,
and import aliases. So you need to use Jen directly here

```go
func WriteGenerator(g Generator, w io.Writer) (error) {
    // Fully qualified package path
    file := jen.NewFilePath("example.com/my/package")
    file.HeaderComment("This file is generated. Do not edit.")
    // Potentially, create aliases for imports
    file.ImportAlias("github.com/tommie/v8go", "v8")
    file.Add(generator.Generate())
    return file.Render(w)
}
```

## Philosophy: Embrace composition

The philosophy is to be able to compose larger structures out of individual
parts. Each level of composition adds a higher level of abstraction.

As an example

- Compose high level file generators from application specific generators
- Compose application specific generators from high level general purpose generators
- Compose high level general purpose generators from low-level general purpose
generators.

### High-level file generators

At the highest level, compose that parts that need to be in the file:

```Go
func FileContents() g.Generator {
    return StatementList(
        TypeGenerator(),
        ConstructorGenerator(),
        MethodsGenerator(),
        )
}
```

### High-level application specific generators

This would be generators created specifically for the types that exist in your
application:

```go
type MyTypeInstance struct {
    g.Generator
}

func (i MyTypeInstance) CallMethod1(arg1 Generator, arg2 Generator) Generator {
    v := g.Value{i.Generator}
    return v.Field("Method1").Call(arg1, arg2)
}

func Body() g.Generator {
    v := MyTypeInstance{g.NewValue("t")}
    return StatementList {
        Assign(v, g.Value("NewMyType").Call()),
        v.CallMethod1(g.Lit("foo"), g.Lit("bar")),
        g.Return(v),
    }
}
```

### High-level general purpose generators

A high-level general purpose generator could be a "Getter", retrieving a private
read-only field:

```Go
type Getter struct {
    FieldName    string
    FieldType    Generator
    ReceiverName Generator
    ReceiverType Generator
}

func (gg Getter) Generate() *jen.Statement {
    return Function{
        Name: g.Id(fmt.Sprintf("Get%s", gg.FieldName),
        Receiver: g.Arg(gg.ReceiverName, gg.ReceiverType),
        RetType: gg.FieldType,
        Body: g.Return(gg.ReceiverName.Field(gg.FieldName)),
    }
}
```
